Working with Parameters Chapter:

Task 1:
Open ParametersProject.
You need to do via API.
Select all walls in a document.
What criteria walls should pass.
-They shouldn't be Curtain Walls,
-their BaseConstraint should be set to level with the name Level 1
-their Base Offset should be more than 1 feet
-the decription of their type should equal to "TheOne"

The answer will be the ROUNDED TO 2 DECIMALS sum of their TYPE ids + Volume.

Additional exercise:
-Create an extension method called Highlight for UIDocument class to easily select elements of the given document(you would need to google how to select elements in Revit via API)
example : uiDocument.Highlight(elements);
-Create an extension method for the document class to run a transaction
example : document.Run(() => {//here we be the code to run}, "TransactionName");
You need a transaction for selecting elements in the UI via API

Answer : 2940.15

Task 2:
Given tasks includes the result of the previous one.
Get all wall types in a document, remove the ones that you get from the previous result.
Get their base constraint levels, and get only unique ones.
e.g. If a list contains 3 elements of the same level, you shoould only get 1.
[Level1, Level1, Level1] => [Level1]
Change the type of the level to the one with the given name : "CustomLevelType"
Increase the elevation of the level by 1.5 feet.
The answer is the sum of elevation values before and after assignment.

Answer : 29.25
